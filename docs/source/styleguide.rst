Style Guide for Data Entry
=========================

There are a few things that you will want to consider with regards to
style/consistency for uploading data:

* How should you capitalize titles of artworks, names of
  organizations, locations, and personal names? What about the pages
  associated with a project?

* Should terms be capitalized or all lowercase?

* Where will you draw the term descriptions from (i.e. how would you
  describe and ARC as opposed to a gallery)?

* How granular do you want your categories to be - i.e. do you want to
  distinguish between a walk-through video as opposed to a
  reproduction of a video artwork? If so, where would that distinction
  take place - in “artwork categories” or “media file categories”?

Recommendations
---------------

#. Title case for the names of Projects ("The Photo-Essay is Dead,
   Long Live the Photo-Essay!")

#. Initial caps for project pages ("Workshop registration
   instructions")
