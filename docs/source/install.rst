Installation
============

.. note::

    BTD doesn't use labeled or numbered releases. The code in the
    master branch of the repository should be runnable.

Make sure the requirements are satisfied.

The BTD application is based on Symfony 3.2. Installation follows the normal
process for installing a Symfony application.

1. Get the code from GitHub. 

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone https://github.com/sfu-dhil/btd.git


1. Get the submodules from Git. There is quite a bit of reusable code in the
application, and it's organized with git submodules.

.. code-block:: bash

  git submodule init
  git submodule update --recursive --remote


1. Create a database and database user.
  
.. code-block:: sql

  create database btd;
  grant all on btd.* to btd@localhost;
  set password for btd@localhost = password('hotpockets');


1. `Install composer`_ if it isn't already installed somewhere.
  
1. Install the composer dependencies. Composer will ask for some 
   configuration variables during installation.
  
.. code-block:: bash

  ./vendor/bin/composer install --no-dev -o
   
Sometimes composer runs out of memory. If that happens, try this alternate.
  
.. code-block:: bash

  php -d memory_limit=-1 ./vendor/bin/composer install --no-dev -o


1. Update file permissions. The user running the web server must be
able to write to `var/cache/*` and `var/logs/*` and
`var/sessions/*`. The symfony docs provide `recommended commands`_
depending on your OS.
  
1. Load the schema into the database. This is done with the 
symfony console.
  
.. code-block:: bash

  ./bin/console doctrine:schema:update --force

  
1. Create an application user with full admin privileges. This is also done 
with the symfony console.
  
.. code-block:: bash

  ./bin/console fos:user:create --super-admin  

  
1. Install bower, npm, and nodejs if you haven't already. Then use bower to 
download and install the javascript and css dependencies.
  
.. code-block:: bash

  bower install


1. Configure the web server. The application's `web/` directory must
be accessible to the world. Symfony provides `example
configurations`_ for most server setups.
  
At this point, the web interface should be up and running, and you should
be able to login by following the Login link in the top right menu bar.

That should be it.
