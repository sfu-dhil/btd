Between the Physical and the Virtual: Anthropology, Art, and Emergent
Digital Hybrid Spaces

Kate Hennessy, School of Interactive Arts and Technology

This project is grounded in the ongoing work of the `Ethnographic
Terminalia Collective`_, which since 2009 has staged annual exhibitions
in major North American cities that explore the intersections of art
and anthropology. It will develop an open access web-based archive of
the ETC exhibitions and pedagogical tool for teaching about
anthropology and art.
