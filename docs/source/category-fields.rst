Category Fields
---------------

Each of the categories has fields for name, label, and
description.

name
  The name field used internally to identify and group the elements in
  a category. It should be lowercase with no spaces. You can use
  dashes, periods, or underscores to replace the spaces if you need
  to.

label
  Labels are human readable. They are free text, although you should
  try to keep them very short but descriptive. They should probably be
  capitalised following the :ref:`styleguide`.

description
  Provide a description of the category element, so that other people
  will be able to choose correctly when entering data based on your
  categories.
