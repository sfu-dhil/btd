Location
========

A location is a geographic place, usually a city. They are organized
by region (typically a state) and by country. A :ref:`venue` is
associated with a location. When viewing a location entry, a list of
venues associated with the location is also displayed.

The list of locations is accessible via the Browse menu in the top
menu bar.
