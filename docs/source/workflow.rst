Workflow and Data Entry
=======================

Suggested workflow for adding content to BTD web tool

The data entry is designed to work on a project-to-project basis. It's
useful to create a paper inventory beforehand, listing all of the
contributors, organizations, locations, and media files that are
included in a project. Once the inventory is complete, you can use
it to check off the data that's already been entered for another
project.

It's also useful to collect all the digital files together into one
place before you begin. If there are media files that need to be
attached to a project, it would be a good idea to collect them all in
one folder. If several people are collecting data for the same
project, then consider storing it in a folder in `SFU Vault`_ while you
organize everything.

Describe the Categories and Roles
---------------------------------

The categories and roles allow data to be organized in the application
and once it has been deposited to the digital repository. Hopefully
the categories and roles will be reusable from project to project,
although you can always add new categories or roles as needed. The
fields in the categories and roles are described in :ref:`category-field`.

Each of the categories and roles is accessible via the Browse menu in
the top menu bar.

Artwork categories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Terms that describe the material or generic features of an artwork,
i.e. installation, dance, performance, painting

Artwork roles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Terms that describe the relationship of a person to an artwork,
i.e. artist (or the more specific “painter”, “sculptor”, etc.),
composer, poet

Media file categories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Terms that describe the generic or content features of the media file,
i.e. a program, an interview, a sample of an artwork. These categories
are intended to describe the content of the media file. The format of
the media file will be described as somewhere else, as metadata.

Project roles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Terms that describe the relationship of a person or organization to a
project, i.e. sponsor, curator, designer, etc.

Project categories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Terms that describe the generic features of a project, i.e. an
exhibition, a workshop, a lecture.

Venue categories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Terms that describe the function or type of space in which a project
took place, i.e. gallery, bookstore, university.

Describe the Project
--------------------

Once you've created the categories and roles necessary for your
project, it's time to begin entering information about the project
itself.

Try not to dupliate any information. For example, if two projects use
the same location, then that location only needs to be entered once.

Location
^^^^^^^^

The geographic location of the project: City, region and country
(i.e. Boston, Massachusetts, USA).

Venue
^^^^^

A venue has a name, address, description, and URL. You can write the
description yourself, or copy/paste it from the venue website. Select
the location and venue category from the drop down menus. 

.. note::

   The Location and Venue Category entries must already be populated.

.. todo::

   Should Venue URL be optional? Should we allow more than one?

People
^^^^^^

A person entry in the database has a full name (John Doe) and a
sortable name (doe, john). The sortable name isn't shown
publicly. Person entries also have biographies.

.. note::

   A biography is different from an artist or project
   statement. Artist statements are entered elsewhere.

Organizations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Organization entries have a name, address, description, URL, contact
information.

.. todo::

   Should Organization URL and contact be optional? Should URL be
   repeatable?

Artworks
^^^^^^^^

Create one entry for each artwork in the project. Describe the artwork
by entering the title, description, materials, and copyright.

.. note::

   You will add images, video, audio and other digital representations
   of the artwork in the next step. This step focuses on a textual
   description of the work.

.. todo::

   Artwork Category seems to be missing from the Artwork data entry
   page.

Media Files
^^^^^^^^^^^

Media files are digital images, photographs, video or audio
recordings, or document scans of artworks. Media files can also
include artist photos, PDFs of project programmes, or other
materials.

Select a media file to upload, and choose the appropriate category
from the drop down list.

Media File Metadata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Describe each of the metadata files that you have uploaded. Metadata
element descriptors are provided by Dublin Core and described in
:ref:`metadata`. Use the metadata system to describe the media file
itself, rather than the physical object it might represent.

Add Media Files to Artworks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Browse to the artwork entries you created earlier and add media files
to the artworks.

Add Media Files to People
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you've uploaded personal photos to the application for use in a
bio, add the media file to the person's entry.

Add project
^^^^^^^^^^^

A project brings together the different parts of of the
application. It is the glue that binds everything together.

Enter the title, start date, end date, venues, excerpt (if needed),
description, URL, project category. If the excerpt is blank, the
application will create an excerpt from the first 100 words in the
description.

.. note::

   Venues and project category are required fields, so if
   you haven’t already populated these fields, you won’t be able to
   add the project

Add media to project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Associate media files of the art works with the project. You shouldn't
add files of the artists or contributors here: they should be
associated with the Person or Artwork pages as appropriate.

Add project contributions to project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Add links between people or organizations and the project. Be sure to
describe the contribution using the contribution role drop down.

Add artworks to project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Create connections between the artworks for a project and the project.

Add project pages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Project pages are things like press releases, call for participation,
registration instructions, or other project-specific information that
needs to be preserved about a project. Don't be shy about creating new
pages for a project to preserve the content, but try not to duplicate
information either. There's a ballance to be found.
